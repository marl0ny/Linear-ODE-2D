# Linear ODEs in 2D
This program is an interactive plot of a two-dimensional homogeneous linear system.
To use this program, you first need to have Python 3 with Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
You must then download or clone this repository and then run `linear_vector_field.py` through the command line.

On the top-right corner of the plot are the two coupled linear ODEs that describe this system.
They are controlled by the parameters a, b, c, and d, which can be changed by using the 
`a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` sliders located on the right side of the window.
To plot a sample trajectory, click anywhere on the plot in order to specify its initial conditions.
To close the application, click the `QUIT` button.
